# OpenMRS Reference Application Content

This is a template repo to be used to set up and share Content Packages.

This content package contains the baseline metadata necessary to run a verison of O3. Please note that while
the metadata here is all that's _required_, this does not provide the metadata necessary for every feature to
work. That is because the metadata needed for various things, like the formulary or procedure catalog is
expected to be customized for most sites.

Additional metadata used in the O3 demo environments is contained in the Reference Application Demo content
package.
